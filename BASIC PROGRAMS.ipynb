    "### 1. Write a Python program to count the number of carry operations for each addition problem.\n",
    "##### According to Wikipedia â€œIn elementary arithmetic, a carry is a digit that is transferred from one column of digits to another column of more significant digits. It is part of the standard algorithm to add numbers together by starting with the rightmost digits and working to the left. For example, when 6 and 7 are added to make 13, the \"3\" is written to the same column and the \"1\" is carried to the left\"."

The opposite or facing sides of a parallelogram are of equal length and the opposite angles of a parallelogram are of equal measure. Rectangles: In Euclidean plane geometry, a rectangle is a quadrilateral with four right angles. It can also be defined as an equiangular quadrilateral, since equiangular means that all of its angles are equal (360Â°/4 = 90Â°). It can also be defined as a parallelogram containing a right angle.\n",

Another name is equilateral quadrilateral, since equilateral means that all of its sides are equal in length. The rhombus is often called a diamond, after the diamonds suit in playing cards which resembles the projection of an octahedral diamond, or a lozenge, though the former sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 60Â° angle, and the latter sometimes refers specifically to a rhombus with a 45Â° angle."
